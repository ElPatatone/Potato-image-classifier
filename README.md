# Potato image classifier (CNN)
### **I love potatoes** :potato:  
So I wanted to make a model that would correctly classify an image as being a potato or not.  
I used `Tensorflow` for the deep learning model, the actual model is a `CNN (Convulutional Neural Network)` as they give the best results when working with images.
